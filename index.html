                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>
                    Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu. He specialized in Aeronautical Engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT).
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Kalam played a crucial role in India’s space and defence development. As the Project Director of SLV-III, he successfully led the development of India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle, which launched the Rohini satellite into near-earth orbit in July 1980, making India a member of the elite Space Club. He was also instrumental in the evolution of PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) at ISRO.
                    <br><br>
                    After serving ISRO for two decades, Dr. Kalam joined DRDO as the Chief Executive of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). Under his leadership, India developed and operationalized strategic missiles such as AGNI and PRITHVI, strengthening the country’s defence self-reliance.
                    <br><br>
                    From July 1992 to December 1999, he served as the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister and Secretary, Department of Defence R&D. During this period, he played a major role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests, which established India as a nuclear weapon state. He also contributed to major defence projects like the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).
                    <br><br>
                    As Chairman of TIFAC, Dr. Kalam led Technology Vision 2020, providing a roadmap to transform India into a developed nation. He later served as the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India (1999–2001) and guided important national missions including India Millennium Mission 2020.
                    <br><br>
                    Dr. Kalam also devoted himself to academics as Professor of Technology & Societal Transformation at Anna University, Chennai, where he inspired students and promoted national development by interacting with youth across the country.
